Hi Tom,

Hope you are both well.

We are hoping to have a party to celebrate the 20th
birthday of ICPUGSE on the 22nd June. If you are 
around we hope you will both come.

Do you still have an address for Kevin Viney? If so
please email it to us as we would like to ask him to 
come to the party too.

Best wishes

Janet and John

Dear all 

Sorry change of venue - its going to be held at 130 not 127 - Phils team is having a meeting on the same night and going down the pub after so if any of you fancy joining them after our meeting - I believe they are off to the Orchard - practicing for the Pool Tournament probably...

Many thanks

btw - can you let me know in advance what you would like to eat so I can get the order in and save time?  Need to know if you want Salt and Vinegar/ketchup etc too.

All, 

Due to the lack of interest in the Amsterdam trip we have decided to cancel that in favour of a weekend in Blackpool to see the illuminations.  The planned dates are 13/14/15 October.  Can you email me back if you are interested, estimated costs are £19 travel and £13 - £20 per night B&B.

Thanks

Emma

Dr Glassborough - She has taken over from Dr Jupp who retired last year
apparently.

We MUST cancel this if we do not need it.

In addition you can call and speak to Dr Glassborough between 10.20 and
11.00 on Thursday morning if you want.

Also sorted out your prescription things - should be at Fishers next time
you go up.

"ENPS Christmas Party!!","2002-12-12","13:00:00","2002-12-12","15:00:00","Bridge Lounge, TVC","Hi Everyone 

Pretend that this rhymes!

'Twas seven weeks before Christmas, when all through the ENPS house
Not a creature is stirring because we are in the middle of roll-outs;
Now its Quantel testing in Evesham and bashing in Belfast,
I bet you the last thing on everyone's mind is Christmast J

So glad that Alan is back snug by his desk,
But Sheila is still in India and Jenny has escaped to Nice;
We are moving our office in a couple of months,
Just hope that everyone can make it to our ENPS Christmas Lunch!

With our schedules a busy sometimes we want to shout
""Now, RadioMan! now, GoDigital! - Just get out!
Now, Jupiter! now, MOS! - We want to be free!""
From the top of White City! to the top of TVC!

The ENPS Christmas Lunch is on Thursday 12th December from 1pm to 3 
Send me names to invite by Friday 15 November, quickly...please!
'Twill be a buffet in the Bridge Lounge with lots of liquids especially beer,
Looking forward to celebrate a job well done and a well deserved good cheer!

Regards
Jacqui

Hi everyone
 
Thanks for volunteering to be a guide / steward.
 
I’ll send further details in due course, but just wanted to get this in your diary and give you an outline of activities, see below:
 
A 'market place' of stalls/stands will greet visitors on the ground floor in the customer centre area. Visitors can find out about various services (cycling related) by chatting with council staff on the various stalls themed on cycling with links to the forthcoming Tour de France.
 

	
*	Stalls to be made up of:

	
*	Information on Tour de France (TdF) route, timings, etc.
*	Planned activities surrounding the event – what’s on, festival atmosphere, street parties, etc.
*	Cycling safety what work is carried out in schools, advice on cycling safety (lights, visibility, etc).
*	City cycling routes around York.
*	Health benefits of cycling - Sport & Active Leisure - information and a cycling activity which links a static cycle to an actual route of the TdF.

 

	
*	Tours around West Offices will stop at the Hudson Board room where historic character actor George Hudson provides a railway connection to celebrate the historic origins of West Offices who using the, “mak all t’ railways cum t’ York” – “mak all t’ world cum t’ York” theme creates a link to how in 2014 CYC will “mak all cycles cum t’ York” with the forthcoming TdF.

 

	
*	A second historic character actor in the form of an edwardian lady cyclist, will play a part commenting on the place of cycling in the women’s emancipation movement of the time.

 

	
*	The promotion video for La Tour will then be shown before moving on a tour around the rest of West Offices which will explain how the various services working behind the scenes at West Offices enable events like TdF to take part.

 

	
*	CANsing choir on level 3.
