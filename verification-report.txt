## Single-Occurrence Stripping (New Feature)
Entries that had occurrenceCount=1 were stripped of recurrence:
- 178 single-occurrence events detected and converted to non-recurring
- Examples: "Private Appointment" entries, various birthdays marked for single year

## Corrupted UNTIL Date Handling
- Corrupted dates (year < 1900) detected and handled
- Small occurrence counts (≤50) preferred COUNT over corrupted UNTIL
- Large spans capped to reasonable limits (5/10/20/100 years by frequency)
